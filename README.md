## Project Description
Security cameras, especially in developed countries are a vital part of the security system. The
“human factor” time and effort for constant monitoring and review of records play a significant
role in effective surveillance and monitoring. Constant monitoring of cameras and review of
lengthy records to identify recorded past events could be a time consuming and even boring
tasks which may delay the response to emergencies.

This project aims to design a cost-effective camera with an element of auto-generated notification
to detect and notify the notifiable events and recognise the objects in real-time to
facilitate immediate emergency response and to efficiently use the recording storage for actual
and potential security events.

By using different available methods, technologies, testing and modifications, the project is
introduced a camera which cost £85.06 to £200 (depending on either it’s used for personal or
business purposes) and successfully performs surveillance, detects motion, recognise objects and
subsequently generate user notification with an efficient recording of actual events.
